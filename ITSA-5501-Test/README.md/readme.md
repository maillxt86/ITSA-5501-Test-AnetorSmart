## GitHub Actions Workflow

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow named **DevOps Test**.  
It runs automatically whenever changes are pushed to the `main` (or `master`) branch.  
The workflow checks out the repository code and prints a confirmation message to indicate that the workflow executed successfully.
